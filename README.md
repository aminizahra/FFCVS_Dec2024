# Computer Vision Exercise Sessions

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Computer Vision Course Exercise Sessions. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks from the tutorial and exercise sessions I conduct as a Teaching Assistant. These notebooks are intended to supplement the lectures and provide practical insights into applying computer vision concepts using Python.

## Contents
Each notebook in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or exercise session in the Computer Vision course. The notebooks contain step-by-step guides, code examples, and explanations to help students grasp the practical aspects of computer vision.

Below is a list of the Jupyter Notebooks available in this repository along with a brief description of each:
- Python:
  1. [Solving Exercises 01](https://github.com/aminizahra/FFCVS_Dec2024/blob/main/Python/SolvingExercises01.ipynb)
  2. ...
## How to Use
To use these notebooks:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or using pip (`pip install notebook`).
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open the notebook files (`.ipynb`) to view the content.

## Topics Covered
The notebooks cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:
- Python Basics
- Feature Detection and Matching
- Object Recognition and Tracking
- Deep Learning in Computer Vision

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Python programming is required to follow these notebooks. Familiarity with computer vision concepts and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch will be beneficial.

## Contributing
Students are encouraged to contribute to this repository by:
- Suggesting improvements or corrections.
- Adding examples or exercises.
- Raising issues for discussion.

## Feedback
Your feedback is valuable in improving these exercise sessions. Feel free to raise issues or contact me directly for any suggestions or queries.
